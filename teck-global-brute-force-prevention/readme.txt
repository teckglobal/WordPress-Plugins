A WordPress plugin by Teck Global to prevent brute force login attacks with IP management and geolocation features.

== Description ==
Teck Global Brute Force Protection is a robust security plugin designed to safeguard your WordPress site from brute force login attacks. It includes advanced features such as IP banning, login attempt logging, a sortable and searchable IP log table, and geolocation visualization using MaxMind's GeoLite2 database and Google Maps.

### Features
- **Brute Force Protection:** Limits login attempts and bans IPs after exceeding the threshold.
- **IP Management:** Add or remove banned IPs via an intuitive interface.
- **IP Logs:** View login attempts in a sortable, searchable table with timestamps.
- **Geolocation:** Visualize IP locations on Google Maps with color-coded dots based on attempt frequency:
  - Red: 26+ attempts from the same country
  - Orange: 11-25 attempts from the same country
  - Green: 1-10 attempts from the same country
- **MaxMind Integration:** Uses the GeoLite2-City.mmdb file (configurable path, default: `/your/path/GeoIP/GeoLite2-City.mmdb`) for geolocation data.

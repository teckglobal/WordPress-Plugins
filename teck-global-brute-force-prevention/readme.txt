A WordPress plugin by TeckGlobal LLC to prevent brute force login attacks with IP management and geolocation features.

== Description ==
TeckGlobal Brute Force Protect is a robust security plugin designed by TeckGlobal LLC to safeguard your WordPress site from brute force login attacks. It includes features like IP banning, a sortable and searchable IP logs table, and geolocation visualization using MaxMind's GeoLite2 database and Google Maps.

### Features:
- **Brute Force Protection**: Configurable login attempt limit before IP ban (default: 5).
- **IP Management**: Add or remove banned IPs via an admin interface or IP Logs table.
- **IP Logs**: View a table of IP logs with timestamps, attempts, ban status, expiry, and country, sortable and searchable, with an option to remove bans.
- **Geolocation**: Displays IP locations on a Google Map with color-coded dots (red: 26+, orange: 11-25, green: 1-10 attempts per country).
- **MaxMind Integration**: Uses a configurable GeoLite2-City.mmdb file path (default: `/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLite2-City.mmdb`) for geolocation lookups.
- **Summary Dashboard**: Displays total brute force attempts, TeckGlobal LLC website link, and an option to upload a logo.
- **Configurable Ban Settings**: Adjust max attempts, ban duration, and auto-ban invalid usernames.
